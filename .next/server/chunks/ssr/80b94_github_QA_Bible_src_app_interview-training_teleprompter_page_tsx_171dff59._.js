I hold a BSc in Multimedia and Internet Technology and have worked across diverse industries including sports technology (Stadion), digital consultancy (Elsewhen), AI/data solutions (Kubrick), water treatment systems (Curio), and insurance (Tempcover). My expertise spans Playwright, Cypress, WebdriverIO, Appium, Detox, Selenium with Python/Pytest, and comprehensive API testing using Postman and Swagger. I specialize in shift-left testing, CI/CD integration, and building scalable test frameworks that improve team velocity and product quality."},{question:"What does QA mean to you?",answer:"QA is about preventing problems, not just finding bugs. My role is to help the team build in quality across the SDLC: from requirements, design, development, testing, to release. I do that with good test strategy, clear communication, and the right level of automation."},{question:"What is the SDLC and where does testing fit?",answer:"SDLC is the Software Development Life Cycle: planning, requirements, design, development, testing, release, and maintenance. Testing happens throughout, not only at the end: requirements reviews, test planning, unit tests, API/UI tests, and production monitoring. I support this with early test design, shift-left testing, and continuous testing in CI/CD."},{question:"Describe your test strategy approach.",answer:"I start with the business goals and risks. I define what to test, what not to test, levels of testing (unit, API, UI) and how much to automate at each layer following the testing pyramid. I then choose tools (Playwright, Cypress, WDIO/Appium, etc.), define entry/exit criteria, and keep the strategy lightweight and adaptable."},{question:"What is your approach to manual testing?",answer:"I combine structured test case execution with deep exploratory testing. At Stadion, I routinely conducted exploratory testing around content management flows, finding edge cases such as form submissions failing when special characters were introduced due to session token expirations. At Elsewhen, I created comprehensive test suites covering critical flows and UI elements, using mind maps to identify user journey gaps. I always document bugs clearly in Jira with reproduction steps, screenshots, cross-browser data, and impact analysis, which helped reduce fix verification time by 25%."},{question:"How do you prioritise test cases?",answer:"I look at risk, user impact, and change frequency. High-risk flows (login, payments, alerts, critical journeys) come first. I also prioritise tests that give fast feedback, e.g., unit/API before UI."},{question:"Explain the bug life cycle.",answer:"Typical states: New → Triaged → In Progress → Fixed → Retest → Verified → Closed. Sometimes it branches to Deferred / Rejected / Duplicate. In triage I help clarify severity vs priority and ensure the team understands impact on users and release."},{question:"How do you decide severity vs priority?",answer:"Severity = how bad is the problem technically or functionally. Priority = how quickly we need to fix it for the business or users. A cosmetic typo: low severity, low priority. A crash on login: high severity, high priority."},{question:"What is the testing pyramid and how do you use it?",answer:"The pyramid says most tests should be unit and API, with a smaller number of slow UI tests. I aim for a broad base of fast, stable tests and a thin top of critical end-to-end flows. This keeps the suite fast, reliable, and cheaper to maintain."},{question:"When do you automate tests?",answer:"I automate stable, repeatable, high-value flows: regression checks, smoke, and critical journeys. I avoid automating constantly changing UI or complex one-off scenarios. I always ask: 'Will this test pay back its maintenance cost?'"},{question:"How do you test a REST API?",answer:"I start with the happy path: correct method, URL, headers, auth, and body → expect correct status and response. Then I add negative tests: missing fields, invalid tokens, boundary values, rate limits, and error handling. I validate status codes, schema, business rules, and performance."},{question:"How do you choose what to test at API vs UI?",answer:"I prefer business rules and data validation at the API level because it's faster and more stable. UI tests focus on end-to-end flows and critical user journeys. This matches the testing pyramid and keeps UI tests lightweight."},{question:"How do you design an automation framework?",answer:"I use Page Object Model or Screen Objects, clear folder structure, and config-driven test data. I separate test logic from locators and utilities, and keep assertions meaningful. I integrate with CI/CD, add reporting (e.g. HTML/Allure), and ensure tests are idempotent and independent."},{question:"How do you keep your tests stable and less flaky?",answer:"I use explicit waits based on conditions, not random sleeps. I choose robust selectors (data-test IDs or accessible locators). I keep tests focused on one thing, clean up data, and avoid hidden dependencies."},{question:"What is Playwright and how have you used it?",answer:"Playwright is a cross-browser automation framework by Microsoft for fast, reliable end-to-end testing. I've used it with TypeScript, Page Objects, and API testing built into the same framework. I use Playwright Test runner for parallel execution, UI mode, and trace viewer to debug failures."},{question:"Why would you choose Playwright?",answer:"It supports Chromium, Firefox, WebKit with one API. Great auto-wait, locator system, codegen, and strong TypeScript support. Ideal for modern web apps and CI-friendly out of the box."},{question:"What is Cypress and how have you used it?",answer:"Cypress is a JavaScript end-to-end testing tool focused on the browser. I've used it for UI tests, API requests during E2E flows, and fixtures. I like the interactive runner, automatic waiting, and time-travel debugging."},{question:"Playwright vs Cypress – how do you compare them?",answer:"Cypress is great for frontend teams who want a very browser-centric experience. Playwright is strong for multi-browser, multi-language, and deep API + UI integration. I choose based on team skills, project needs, and CI constraints."},{question:"How have you used WebdriverIO and Appium?",answer:"I've used WebdriverIO as the main test runner and Appium as the mobile automation layer for iOS and Android. I built screen objects, used accessibility IDs/XPath, and ran tests on simulators/emulators and real devices. I integrated with CI and used environment variables for sensitive data."},{question:"What are the challenges in mobile automation?",answer:"Devices and OS versions differ, so I focus on stable locators and realistic test data. Mobile is slower, so I keep the suite lean and focused on high-value user journeys. I combine automation + manual exploratory testing for full coverage."},{question:"What is Detox and when would you use it?",answer:"Detox is an end-to-end testing framework for React Native apps, with a focus on synchronisation with the app. I'd use it when the team is heavily React Native, and we want tests that integrate well into the JS/TS toolchain."},{question:"What is Maestro?",answer:"Maestro is a mobile UI testing framework that uses simple YAML 'flows' to describe interactions. It's great for high-level E2E flows, smoke tests, and fast-to-write scenarios."},{question:"Tell me about your Selenium/Python experience.",answer:"I've used Selenium WebDriver with Pytest to automate browser flows with page objects and fixtures. I like Pytest for its fixture system and parametrisation, which helps create data-driven tests. For new projects I often prefer Playwright or Cypress, but Selenium is still useful for legacy systems."},{question:"How do you see AI impacting testing?",answer:"AI helps with test case generation, risk analysis, and code suggestions, but it doesn't replace critical thinking. I use AI to brainstorm scenarios, optimize suites, and refactor code, then I review everything critically. I see AI as a powerful assistant, not an autopilot."},{question:"How do you use AI day-to-day as a tester?",answer:"To expand edge cases, generate test data, and summarise logs or reports. To create draft automation code or Postman collections, which I then clean up. To help design lean test strategies and identify duplicated tests."},{question:"Tell me about a time you improved testing on a project.",answer:"At Kubrick Group, I established QA processes from scratch for their AI and data consultancy. The team had inconsistent testing approaches across projects. I created comprehensive test strategies, built automation scripts for regression and smoke testing, and implemented a bug triage workflow that integrated with Instabug. This improved efficiency and minimized manual work. At Curio, I led automation of web testing, facing challenges with unstable environments and frequent requirement changes. I created modular, reusable test scripts with Cypress and TypeScript, ensuring flexibility. These efforts resulted in more reliable QA processes that reduced test cycle times and improved overall product stability."},{question:"Describe a time you handled a critical production bug.",answer:"Situation: A production issue affected a key flow (e.g. login/payment). Task: Help reproduce, communicate impact, and verify the fix quickly. Action: I captured logs and steps, helped the dev isolate the issue, and then added a regression test (API/UI) so it wouldn't return. Result: The issue was fixed quickly, and we prevented the same bug from re-appearing."}];function e(){let[a,e]=(0,c.useState)(null);return(0,b.jsxs)("div",{className:"min-h-screen bg-black text-white p-8",children:[(0,b.jsx)("h1",{className:"text-4xl font-bold mb-8 text-center",children:"QA Teleprompter - Record Mode"}),(0,b.jsx)("div",{className:"max-w-4xl mx-auto space-y-4",children:d.map((c,d)=>(0,b.jsxs)("div",{className:"border border-gray-700 rounded-lg",children:[(0,b.jsxs)("button",{onClick:()=>{e(a===d?null:d)},className:"w-full text-left p-6 text-2xl font-semibold hover:bg-gray-800 rounded-lg transition-colors",children:["Q: ",c.question]}),a===d&&(0,b.jsxs)("div",{className:"p-6 text-xl leading-relaxed bg-gray-900 rounded-b-lg",children:["A: ",c.answer]})]},d))})]})}a.s(["default",()=>e])}];
